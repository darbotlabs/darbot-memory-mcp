## Usage

### Getting Started

1. **Configure Server Path**: Set the path to your Darbot Memory MCP server executable in settings
2. **Start Server**: Use the "Start MCP Server" command or enable auto-start
3. **Capture Workspace**: Use "Capture Current Workspace" to save your development state
4. **Search & Browse**: Use the conversation search and browsing features to find information

### Typical Workflow

1. **Development Session Start**: VS Code starts and optionally auto-starts the MCP server
2. **Workspace Capture**: Capture your workspace state at key development milestones
3. **Conversation Tracking**: The server automatically tracks AI conversations and tool usage
4. **Search & Reference**: Use the search functionality to find previous conversations and solutions
5. **Context Restoration**: Restore previous workspace states as needed

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.85.0 or higher
- Darbot Memory MCP server executable
- Node.js runtime (for extension execution)
